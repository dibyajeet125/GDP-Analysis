# GDP-Analysis
Developed a comprehensive GDP analysis project  using Python, which involved data manipulation with Pandas to calculate GDP growth rates for various countries. Created interactive visualizations for GDP comparisons among selected countries and generated individual country reports.

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of GDP data from multiple countries, aiming to uncover patterns and trends that can inform economic understanding and policy recommendations. Using Python, the project employs libraries like Pandas for data manipulation and Plotly for interactive visualizations.

Key components of the project include:
Data Exploration: The GDP dataset is loaded, and basic statistics are generated to understand the structure and range of the data.
Growth Rate Calculation: Year-over-year GDP growth rates are computed for each country, allowing for insights into economic performance over time.
Visualization: Various plots are created to visualize GDP trends for individual countries, regions like the Arab World, and comparative analyses between major economies such as India and China.
